medium and large lorem ipsum should be put in temp directory

Change remaining tests to use new system
    ensure all 10 tests pass

Have /test/temp added to gitignore
Have medium and large lorem ipsum files generated/read from /test/temp
Consider making large test a bit smaller (rather than 9000 instances, just have 900?)
    this will make the test significantly faster

Probably want to make a test directory since there are so many test files now
    fix test system
    should be able to run tests using make:
        make (build executables)
        make test (should go into the /test directory and run the test script there)
        make clean (should clear the temp directory and all compiled executables)

Implement a membership protocol (let's try gossip style heartbeating with fail/delete and suspicion)
    Consider looking at/using the API provided by the Coursera MP1 project
    failure must be reflected at one node within 3 seconds
        this requires heart-beating at least once per 1.5 seconds (if using 1.5 seconds for TFAIL and 1.5 seconds for TDELETE)
    failure must be reflected in all nodes within 6 seconds
    each machine must join with a version number (using fail-stop rather than fail-recovery model)
    use UDP for membership messaging
    log all joins, voluntary leaves and failures
    Implement a way to drop messages on receiver end (default to 0%)
