Tests failing now for some reason
    It's mostly due to fact that 


Renaming member_list to memberlist might be a good idea to simplify reading

peer joins successfully tests
    start node 3000
    start node 3001
    ...
    start node 3007

    All 8 nodes should log peers that join/leave
    Ensure that all 8 logs contain 8 joins and 0 fails

Tests need to be quick, so maybe consider setting T_FAIL/T_CLEANUP to make testing fast - can do this after 

peer can't connect to introducer
    start node 3001
    ...
    start node 3007

    Ensure that all 7 logs contain 1 join each and 0 fails

write membership tests
    peer joins successfully
        should be checking logs
    peer fails joins (introducer down)
    one peer fails
    less than half peers fail
    more than half peers fail
    all non-introducer peers fail
    introducer fails
    introducer rejoins

    How should files be stored?  Who stores them?
    write a disk_scheduler


Strange bug with having to resend requests that fail sometimes...
    node_send_msg is using sleep to try up to 4 times
    why is this necessary?  Are connections dropped due to listener spending too much time copying message into message queue?
    If that's the case, can spawning a thread to handle this in the listener (so that the listener thread only makes connections)
    make hit error less likely?
