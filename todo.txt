Push to git so that we have something to show in portfolio

Probably want to make a test directory since there are so many test files now

Make a script to run a single test
    this makes it easier to debug a single node
    could also have this script only active a single node

Need to be able to run some tests only since bash scripts are breaking and it's hard to debug
    #./dgrep Lorem *.log | grep Lorem | wc -l <---------this line medium-sized result test is failing
    this crashes all 8 nodes - we know because trying to kill processes running on ports 3000-3007 fails since they already crashed

Medium-Sized Result Test - this fails probably due to buffers being stack allocated and too small
    for some reason the nodes are failing after the test runs (error messages when we try to manually shut them down)
Large-Sized Result Test
    probably should disable this since it could take a long time
Failed Node Test
